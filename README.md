## Introduction

> Data is everywhere. In order to get the best out of it one needs to extract it from several sources, make required transformations and load it to a data warehouse for further analysis and explorations. This is where ETL data pipelines come to use.
>
> ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load. An ETL tool extracts the data from different RDBMS source systems, real time user interactions and sever other sorts of transactions. Then the extracted data will be transformed using transformations which are almost always specific to the goal of the project like applying calculations, concatenate, analyze, and aggregate etc. And then load the data to Data Warehouse system. The data is loaded in the DW system in the form of dimension and fact tables, which can serve as the basis for which the bushiness analyzers, bushiness intelligence officers and machine learning teams can continue to work on with.

## Overview

> Our client [10 Academy](https://www.10academy.org/), recognizing the value of large data sets for speech-t0-text data sets, and seeing the opportunity that there are many text corpuses for Amharic and Swahili languages, and understanding that complex data engineering skills is valuable to our profile for employers, wants to have a design and build a robust, large scale, fault tolerant, highly available Kafka cluster that can be used to post a sentence and receive an audio file.
>
> Producing a tool that can be deployed to process posting and receiving text and audio files from and into a data lake, apply transformation in a distributed manner, and load it into a warehouse in a suitable format to train a speech-t0-text model.

## Objective

> The objective of this week‚Äôs project is to build a data engineering pipeline that allows recording millions of Amharic and Swahili speakers reading digital texts in-app and web platforms
>
> This can be achieved by building an end-to-end ETL data pipeline that will use Apache Kafka, Apache Spark and Apache Airflow in order to receive user voice audio files, transform them and load them to a data warehouse that will latter be used for text-to-speech conversion machine learning project.
>
> Users will be prompt with several different sentences and they will provide their corresponding audio by recording using the front end user interface that is provided.
